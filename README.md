## My process

I made the whole website first for desktop then made each section responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

More key components to usinf Flexbox and to making them responsive.

### Continued development

As mentioned in the beginning, I built the whole website and then started to make it responsive at the end, however I have now been made aware that you should do everything in steps as opposed to leaving the responsiveness till the end)
